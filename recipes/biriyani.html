    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish that originated in South Asia. It is traditionally prepared using rice, meat (such
        as chicken, goat, or beef) or seafood, along with vegetables and aromatic spices. The dish was developed during
        the Mughal era in India, though its exact origin is still debated. Biryani is believed to have evolved from the
        Persian pilau rice dish.</p>

        <li>Red Chili Powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>

        <li>Fried Onions (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Protein: In a bowl, combine your choice of protein (chicken, mutton, or vegetables) with
            yogurt,
            ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, biryani masala, lemon juice, and salt. Let it marinate for
            at least 1 hour (overnight is best for deeper flavor).</li>
        <li>Fry the Onions: Slice onions thinly and deep-fry them in oil/ghee until dark golden brown (Birista). Set
            aside.</li>

        <li>Cook the Rice: Boil a large pot of water with whole spices (cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, bay leaf). Add
            soaked basmati rice and cook until it is only 70% done (still has a bite). Drain and set aside.</li>

        <li>Cook the Masala: In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat ghee. Add the marinated meat/veg and cook until the protein
            is sealed and the oil starts to separate from the gravy.</li>

        <li>Layering: Lower the heat. On top of the cooked masala, spread a layer of the par-boiled rice.</li>

        <li>Add Aromatics: Sprinkle fried onions, chopped mint, and coriander over the rice layer.</li>

        <li>Final Topping: Drizzle saffron milk and a little ghee over the very top.</li>

        <li>Dum (Steam): Seal the pot tightly with a lid (or foil) to trap the steam. Cook on very low heat for 15–20
            minutes (25–30 if using mutton).</li>

        <li>Fluff: Gently mix the layers with a fork before serving, being careful not to break the long rice grains.
    </ol>
