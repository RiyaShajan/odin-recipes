        <li>Add Spices: Lower the heat and add turmeric, red chili powder, and coriander powder. Mix

        <li>Final Touch: Drizzle a little coconut oil and add fresh curry leaves. Switch off the heat.</li>

        <li>Rest and Serve: Let the curry rest for 15–20 minutes before serving. Serve hot with rice.</li>
